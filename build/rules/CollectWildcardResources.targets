  <!--
    The vcxproj system does not support wildcards at the root level of a project.
    This poses a problem, as we want to include resw files that are not checked into the
    repository. Since they're usually localized and stored in directories named after
    their languages, we can't exactly explicitly simultaneously list them all and remain
    sane. We want to use wildcards to make our lives easier.

    This rule takes OCResourceDirectory items and includes all resw files that live
    underneath them.

    ** TIRED **
    (does not work because of wildcards)
    <PRIResource Include="Resources/*/Resources.resw" />

    ** WIRED **
    (keep the en-US resource in the project, because it is checked in and VS will show it)
    <PRIResource Include="Resources/en-US/Resources.resw" />
    <OCResourceDirectory Include="Resources" />
