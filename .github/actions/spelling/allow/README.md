# Allow files are lists of words to accept unconditionally

While check spelling will complain about an expected word
which is no longer present, you can include things here even if
they are not otherwise present in the repository.

E.g., you could include a list of system APIs here, or potential
contributors (so that if a future commit includes their name,
it'll be accepted).

## Files

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [Allow](allow.txt) | Supplements to the dictionary |
| [Chinese](chinese.txt) | Chinese words |
| [Japanese](japanese.txt) | Japanese words |
| [Microsoft](microsoft.txt) | Microsoft brand items |
| [Fonts](fonts.txt) | Font names |
