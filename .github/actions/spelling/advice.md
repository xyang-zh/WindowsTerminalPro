By default the command suggestion will generate a file named based on your commit. That's generally ok as long as you add the file to your commit. Someone can reorganize it later.

:warning: The command is written for posix shells. If it doesn't work for you, you can manually _add_ (one word per line) / _remove_ items to `expect.txt` and the `excludes.txt` files.

If the listed items are:

* ... **misspelled**, then please *correct* them instead of using the command.
* ... *names*, please add them to `.github/actions/spelling/allow/names.txt`.
* ... APIs, you can add them to a file in `.github/actions/spelling/allow/`.
* ... just things you're using, please add them to an appropriate file in `.github/actions/spelling/expect/`.
* ... tokens you only need in one place and shouldn't *generally be used*, you can add an item in an appropriate file in `.github/actions/spelling/patterns/`.

See the `README.md` in each directory for more information.

:microscope: You can test your commits **without** *appending* to a PR by creating a new branch with that extra change and pushing it to your fork. The [check-spelling](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/check-spelling) action will run in response to your **push** -- it doesn't require an open pull request. By using such a branch, you can limit the number of typos your peers see you make. :wink:


<details><summary>If the flagged items are :exploding_head: false positives</summary>

If items relate to a ...
* binary file (or some other file you wouldn't want to check at all).

  Please add a file path to the `excludes.txt` file matching the containing file.

  File paths are Perl 5 Regular Expressions - you can [test](
https://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/perl/) yours before committing to verify it will match your files.

  `^` refers to the file's path from the root of the repository, so `^README\.md$` would exclude [README.md](
../tree/HEAD/README.md) (on whichever branch you're using).

* well-formed pattern.

  If you can write a [pattern](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Configuration-Examples:-patterns) that would match it,
  try adding it to the `patterns.txt` file.

  Patterns are Perl 5 Regular Expressions - you can [test](
https://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/perl/) yours before committing to verify it will match your lines.

  Note that patterns can't match multiline strings.
