Routine Description:
    This routine updates the cursor position.  Its input is the non-special
    cased new location of the cursor.  For example, if the cursor were being
    moved one space backwards from the left edge of the screen, the X
    coordinate would be -1.  This routine would set the X coordinate to
    the right edge of the screen and decrement the Y coordinate by one.

Arguments:
    pScreenInfo - Pointer to screen buffer information structure.
    coordCursor - New location of cursor.
    fKeepCursorVisible - TRUE if changing window origin desirable when hit right edge

Return Value:

Routine Description:
    This routine writes a string to the screen, processing any embedded
    unicode characters.  The string is also copied to the input buffer, if
    the output mode is line mode.

Arguments:
    ScreenInfo - Pointer to screen buffer information structure.
    lpBufferBackupLimit - Pointer to beginning of buffer.
    lpBuffer - Pointer to buffer to copy string to.  assumed to be at least
        as long as lpRealUnicodeString.  This pointer is updated to point to the
        next position in the buffer.
    lpRealUnicodeString - Pointer to string to write.
    NumBytes - On input, number of bytes to write.  On output, number of
        bytes written.
    NumSpaces - On output, the number of spaces consumed by the written characters.
    dwFlags -
      WC_DESTRUCTIVE_BACKSPACE   backspace overwrites characters.
      WC_KEEP_CURSOR_VISIBLE     change window origin desirable when hit rt. edge
      WC_PRINTABLE_CONTROL_CHARS if control characters should be expanded (as in, to "^X")

Return Value:

Note:
    This routine does not process tabs and backspace properly.  That code
    will be implemented as part of the line editing services.
