# Coding Style

## Philosophy
1. If it's inserting something into the existing classes/functions, try to follow the existing style as closely as possible.
1. If it's brand new code or refactoring a complete class or area of the code, please follow as Modern C++ of a style as you can and reference the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines) as much as you possibly can.
1. When working with any Win32 or NT API, please try to use the [Windows Implementation Library](./WIL.md) smart pointers and result handlers.
1. The use of NTSTATUS as a result code is discouraged, HRESULT or exceptions are preferred. Functions should not return a status code if they would always return a successful status code. Any function that returns a status code should be marked `noexcept` and have the `nodiscard` attribute.
1. When contributing code in `TerminalApp`, be mindful to appropriately use C++/WinRT [strong and weak references](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/weak-references), and have a good understanding of C++/WinRT [concurrency schemes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/concurrency).
