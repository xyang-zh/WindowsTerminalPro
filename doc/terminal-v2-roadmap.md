## Issue Triage & Prioritization

Incoming issues/asks/etc. are triaged several times a week, labeled appropriately, and assigned to a milestone in priority order:

* P0 (serious crashes, data loss, etc.) issues are scheduled to be dealt with ASAP
* P1/2 issues/features/asks  assigned to the current or future milestone, or to the [Terminal 2.0 milestone](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/milestone/22) for future assignment, if required to deliver a 2.0 feature
* Issues/features/asks not on our list of 2.0 features are assigned to the [Terminal Backlog](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/milestone/7) for subsequent triage, prioritization & scheduling.

## 2.0 Scenarios

The following are a list of the key scenarios we're aiming to deliver for Terminal 2.0.
